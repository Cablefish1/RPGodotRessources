**[Make an Action RPG in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a)** - Video Tutorial for Godot 3.X by Heartbeast

Heartbeast's excellent action RPG tutorial. It's free and a really good introduction to many godot features. He's really pleasant to listen to and explains the stuff really well!

**[Create an RPG in Godot](https://gamedevacademy.org/rpg-godot-tutorial/)** - Written Tutorial for Godot 3.X by GameDevAcademy

A very basic tutorial for making a simple action RPG in Godot. It's text and not video-based however it doesn't really explain a lot. The best thing i can say about it is that you'll have a working RPG prototype really fast if you're following this one.

**[Ressource based RPG Items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR0nCFJ8-qM)** - Video Tutorial for Godot 3.X by Jacob Foxe

The videos are a bit messy and lacks the grace of HeartBeasts videos. But they are nice. He's obviously RPG oriented and he does manage to get tools and tips across.
