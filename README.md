## Tutorials and guides

**[Create an RPG in Godot](https://gamedevacademy.org/rpg-godot-tutorial/)** - Written Tutorial for Godot 3.X by GameDevAcademy

A very basic tutorial for making a simple action RPG in Godot. It's text and not video-based however it doesn't really explain a lot. The best thing i can say about it is that you'll have a working RPG prototype really fast if you're following this one.

**[Make an Action RPG in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a)** - Video Tutorial for Godot 3.X by Heartbeast

Heartbeast's excellent action RPG tutorial. It's free and a really good introduction to many godot features. He's really pleasant to listen to and explains the stuff really well!

**[Ressource based RPG Items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR0nCFJ8-qM)** - Video Tutorial for Godot 3.X by Jacob Foxe

The videos are a bit messy and lacks the grace of HeartBeasts videos. But they are nice. He's obviously RPG oriented and he does manage to get tools and tips across.

**[Godot 2D Secrets](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses/godot-2d-secrets)** - Paid tutorial by GDQuest.
This is an intermediate godot course that covers a wide range of topics and game genres. It has a few rpg specific courses such as:
- Japanese RPG Combat: core systems
- Tactical JRPG movement
- Japanese RPG Combat: User Interface
Even the non-rpg tuts are useful such as the best practices and the visual  novel. Also the gdquest team are very responsive on the site and their discord server(anyone can join that even if they have not paid for a course).
