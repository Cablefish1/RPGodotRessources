Heartbeast's excellent action RPG tutorial. It's free and a really good introduction to many godot features. He's really pleasant to listen to and explains the stuff really well!

**[Create an RPG in Godot](https://gamedevacademy.org/rpg-godot-tutorial/)** - Written Tutorial for Godot 3.X by GameDevAcademy

A very basic tutorial for making a simple action RPG in Godot. It's text and not video-based however it doesn't really explain a lot. The best thing i can say about it is that you'll have a working RPG prototype really fast if you're following this one.
